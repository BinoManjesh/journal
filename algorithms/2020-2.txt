Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept size of matrix, m and n
Step 3: Accept the matrix, mat
Step 4: Display mat
Step 5: For each integer i from 0 to m - 1, do steps 6 to 9
Step 6: Initialize int variable dec to 0
Step 7: For each integer j from 0 to n - 1, do steps 8
Step 8: Add mat[i][j] into 8 to the power (n - 1 - j) to dec
Step 9: Print dec
Step 10: Stop
