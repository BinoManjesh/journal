Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept the lower and upper bound and store them in m and n respectively
Step 3: Initialize int freq to 0
Step 4: For each integer i between m and n, do steps 4 to 12
Step 5: If i is divisible by any integer between 2 and i-1, it is not a Prime number else it is
Step 6: Find square of i
Step 8: Find reverse of i
Step 9: Find square of the number obtained in step 8
Step 10: Find reverse of the number obtained in step 9
Step 11: If the number obtained in step 6 is equal to the number obtained in step 10, i is an Adam number
Step 12: If i is both a Prime and Adam number print i and increment freq
Step 13: Stop
