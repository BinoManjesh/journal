Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept the lower and upper bound and store them in m and n respectively
Step 3: For each integer i between m and n, do steps 4 to 8
Step 4: If i is divisible by any integer between 2 and i-1, it is not a prime number else it is
Step 5: Initialize int c to i and int rev to 0
Step 6: Set rev to rev * 10 + (the remainder on dividing c by 10)
Step 7: Divide c by 10 and go to step 6 if c is greater than 0
Step 8: If i is prime and rev is equal to i, print i
Step 9: Stop
