Read int n
Let int remainder = n, totalCartons = 0
For each int i from 48 to 6, dividing i by 2 each iteration:
	Let int carton = remainder/i
	If cartons =/= 0:
		Print (i + " X " + cartons + " = " + i*cartons)
		Set remainder = remainder%i
		Add cartons to totalCartons
Print remainder
Print n
Print totalCartons
