Read int n
Read int array a of size n
For each int i from 0 to n-1:
	For each int j from i + 1 to n-1:
		If a[j] < a[i]
			swap a[i] and a[j]
Print a
Let b = int matrix of size nXn
For each int i from 0 to n - 1:
	Let int offset = 0
	For each int j from 0 to n-1:
		Set b[i][j] = a[j-offset]
		If j = n - i - 1
			Set offset = j + 1
Print b
