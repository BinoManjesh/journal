Read int m, n
If m < 0 or m >= 10 or n <= 2 or n >= 6, Stop
Read matrix matrix of size mXn
If any element in matrix is invalid, Stop
For int i from 0 to m - 1:
    Let int dec = 0
    For int j from 0 to n - 1:
        Add matrix[i][j] X 8^(n - 1 - j) to dec
        Print matrix[i][j]
    Print dec
